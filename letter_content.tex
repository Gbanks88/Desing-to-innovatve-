Ethics
Ethics refers to the set of principles and guidelines that govern the behavior of individuals within a society or profession. They are often codified in laws, regulations, and professional codes of conduct. Ethics provides a system for determining what is right or wrong and helps maintain order and trust in society.

 				Key Ethical Theories

- Deontology: Founded by Immanuel Kant, this theory emphasizes duty and rules. Actions are considered ethical if they follow a set of established rules or duties, regardless of the consequences.
- Utilitarianism: Popularized by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, this theory focuses on the consequences of actions. An action is considered ethical if it maximizes overall happiness and minimizes suffering.

- Virtue Ethics: Rooted in Aristotle's philosophy, this theory emphasizes character and virtues. Ethical behavior is determined by cultivating virtues such as honesty, courage, and compassion.
- Care Ethics: Emphasizes the importance of relationships and care in ethical decision-making. It focuses on empathy, compassion, and the interconnectedness of individuals.

 					Morality

Morality refers to the beliefs, values, and principles that individuals hold about what is right and wrong. Morals are often influenced by culture, religion, and personal experiences. They provide a personal compass for behavior and decision-making.

 Key Concepts in Morality
- Moral Absolutism: The belief that there are absolute, unchanging moral principles that apply universally.

- Moral Relativism: The belief that moral principles are relative to cultural, social, or personal contexts. What is considered moral in one society may not be in another.
- Moral Subjectivism: The belief that moral judgments are based on individual preferences and feelings.

 				Ethical and Moral Laws
- Legal Ethics: Regulations and codes of conduct for professionals, such as lawyers and doctors, to ensure they act in the best interests of their clients and patients.
- Corporate Ethics: Guidelines and policies that businesses follow to ensure they operate ethically, including fair treatment of employees, honest advertising, and corporate social responsibility.

- Personal Morality: The individual's principles and values that guide their behavior and decision-making in everyday life.
